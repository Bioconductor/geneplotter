    \itemize{
      \item Using NEWS.Rd
      \item The interpretation of the argument \code{bw} by the function
  \code{\link{multidensity}} has been changed with the aim to make the
  behaviour more robust when the data ranges or sample sizes of the
  groups are quite different. Also, to allow more control, \code{bw}
  can now also be a vector, with elements corresponding to the different
  groups.}
